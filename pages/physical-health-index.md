## Pain
{:#pain}
Acupuncture is excellent at reducing or removing the sensation of pain, so, while it can't help everyone, it is very likely that Acupuncture can help you. Having had many patients suffering with different kinds of chronic and acute pain over the years I have come to understand how emotionally tiring and difficult it can be dealing with ongoing pain; many of my patients initially describe feeling trapped, depressed or anxious aswell as exhausted. Traditional Acupuncture supports us emotionally taking the pressure pout of our feelings and improving our energy helping us feel stringer and more able to deal with our situation.

Although, as a complete system of medicine, Acupuncture treats a very wide range of conditions, it is best known in the west for treating pain. In fact NICE (the UK body who determine best practise)  stated that research shows Acupuncture to be the only form of treatment, conventional or complementary that effectively treats tension headaches or migraine.  In addition they identified that over-prescription of medication is one of the most common causes of these kinds of headaches.

Acupuncture does not just treat headaches, it is well known for helping alleviate the sensation of many muscle and joint type pains and over the years I have seen many other pain conditions respond well to treatment.

Aswell as Acupuncture I am also trained in Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Guasha and Cupping which are all Chinese medical skills that can be helpful with pain.

People sometimes come to Acupuncture as a last resort after they have failed to find help elsewhere but even in these situations where a condition has got worse because of a lack of effective treatment,  there is often a lot that Acupuncture can do to help.

## Physical Health Conditions
{:#physical-health}
Acupuncture has a very regulating effect on the body and so is often used to help with things like digestive disturbance, skin conditions, muscular problems, menstrual cycle difficulties, and pain conditions, it is also useful with situations like ME where there are difficulties with energy levels and with immune system issues.

Of course, just like other systems of medicine, Acupuncture cannot help everything, so one of the first things I do when we speak is find out about what is giving you trouble so that I can make an assessment of how likely it is that Acupuncture can help you, this helps support you then to think about it and be able to make a realistic, informed, decision about whether Acupuncture is right for you. If I canâ€™t help you then I can suggest other reliable, professional practitioners in the local area who may be able to.

Life is of course for living and by helping your body help itself Acupuncture helps you live life on your terms.
