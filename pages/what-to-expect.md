## What to Expect
Acupuncture is an amazing and gentle form of medicine so the first thing you or your child should expect is to feel 
  *comfortable
  *cared for and 
  *to get well.

 The reason I spent 4 years training as a full Traditional Acupuncturist is to help people so please treat the clinic room as your own space and ask me for anything that will help you feel most at your ease.

### About Treatment
Treatment usually involves the gentle insertion of Acupuncture needles but can also involve other Chinese Medical treatment techniques. If I think a different treatment method will be helpful then I discuss this with you first to check you are happy about it, nothing happens in the treatment room without your explicit consent so if there is a reason you are not sure about a particular approach then we can always discuss alternative options.
You can [find descriptions of the treatment techniques I am trained in here](https://www.clearspringacupuncture.co.uk/about-acupuncture/treatment-methods.html)

Treatment happens with you sitting or lying on a comfortable treatment couch. The position you are in depends on what you are comfortable with and what Acupuncture points I need to access to treat you. There are Acupuncture points all over the body but for any condition there are multiple points that can be used so if there is a reason why you can’t sit or lie in a particular position or you don’t wish to uncover a particular part of your body then I can accommodate this.  The treatment couch can easily be raised and lowered so if you have mobility problems this can help.
