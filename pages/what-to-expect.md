## What to Expect
Acupuncture is an amazing and gentle form of medicine so the first thing you or your child should expect is to feel 
  * comfortable
  * cared for and 
  * to get well.

 I left my previous career to dedicate my work as a Traditional Acupuncturist so I could help people, so please feel completely happy to ask me for anything that you need or which will help you feel comfortable.

### About The Initial Consultation
The initial consultation is where we discuss your situation so you can tell me everything that is important to you and so I can gather a comprehensive understanding of your health and wellbeing and what you want help with. This is followed by treatment.

Some people are surprised that this consultation covers parts of your wellbeing that seem unconnected to the issues you want help with;  naturally, it seems odd to ask about your appetite when you have fertility issues or when your child has migraines!  The reason is that diagnosis in Traditional Acupuncture and other kinds of Chinese Medicine works by taking an overview of all of your wellbeing and spotting patterns in this that guide us to the best treatment for a specific issue. By understanding where there are areas in which your body's functioning that are not working as well they could, we can understand what the root of your problem is and fix it.  
**This resolves the source of your symptoms and so they stop.**

You **remain clothed** for both the initial consultation and treatment.  Depending on what you need help with, I may ask to press areas on your body such as your belly, your back or on your arms and legs, this is because feelings of tenderness in specific areas can give clues as to what is the best kind of treatment for a problem. 

Your treatment and your comfort are always my first priorities so, nothing happens without your consent. 

### About Treatment


Treatment usually involves the gentle insertion of Acupuncture needles but can also involve other Chinese Medical treatment techniques. If I think a different treatment method will be helpful then I discuss this with you first to check you are happy about it, nothing happens in the treatment room without your explicit consent so if there is a reason you don't feel comfortable with a particular kind of treatment, then you can let me know and we can discuss alternative options.

Treatment happens with you sitting or lying on a comfortable treatment couch. The position you are in depends on what you are comfortable with and what Acupuncture points I need to use to treat you. There are Acupuncture points all over the body but for any condition there are multiple points that could be used so if there is a reason why you can’t sit or lie in a particular position or you don’t wish to be treated on a particular part of your body then it is usually simple to make changes.  The treatment couch can easily be raised and lowered so if you have mobility problems this can help.

If your clothes are too tight or don't allow for me to treat you where you need treatment then I leave the room and so you can change into treatment gowns that preserve you privacy.

Your treatment and your comfort are always my first priorities so at all times you are in control of whether you want a particular treatment, nothing happens without your consent.
