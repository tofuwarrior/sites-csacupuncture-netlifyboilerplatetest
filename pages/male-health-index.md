### Prostatitis

If you are experiencing symptoms of frequent urination, hesitancy, dribbling, pain with urination or getting up to urinate during the night, acupuncture and Eastern Medicine provides a systematic approach to the overall body constitution and the underlying causes of your symptoms. Prostatitis is the inflammation of the prostate that can cause urinary symptoms and pelvic pain.  The most common type is chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Symptoms may include a frequent and urgent need to urinate, pain or a burning sensation when urinating or pain in the pelvic area, lower back and genital area.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

As men age, the prostate naturally increases in size. If the prostate compresses the urethra, it can cause a range of urinary symptoms.  This is known as BPH and affects about 50% of men over 60.  Symptoms include hesitancy or difficulty starting to urinate, slowness or dribbling of the urinary stream, frequent urination and, very commonly, the need to get up at night to urinate. Acupuncture can help with many issues relating to the urinary system.


### Prostate cancer

Prostate cancer affects about one in six men. It can respond very well to treatment when caught early, so it is recommended that all men over the age of 50 get regular prostate cancer screenings.  Urinary problems, pain in the lower back or hips and blood in the urine or semen are common symptoms of prostate cancer.  If you or a loved one is diagnosed with prostate cancer, Acupuncture can be helpful in relieving the side effects of treatment and boosting overall health.

### Erectile Dysfunction (ED)

Medically, ED is diagnosed as the inability to maintain an erection suitable for sexual intercourse **at least a quarter of attempts**.  This is a very common situation that happens to most men at sometime , but ongoing problems could indicate a more serious issue.  ED can be caused by health conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, clogged blood vessels  or diabetes.  Other causes include medications, stress, depression and anxiety.   Acupuncture can be helpful in boosting and supporting sexual stamina and in addressing issues like stress and emotional states that get in the way of sexual activity.

### Fertility ISsues

Male fertility issues usually involve poor movement, poor quality or low concentration of sperm. Research has shown that Acupuncture can improve both production and quality of sperm. It can also increase the chances of successful pregnancy when used in conjunction with Assisted Reproduction Tehcniques (ART) like IVF. Acupuncture can also offer help for both partners with dealing well with the emotional aspects of struggling to conceive.

### Male Menopause

As we age, production of the testosterone, the male hormone, can decline. Symptoms like weakness, low or variable mood, fatigue or low energy levels and sexual issues can happen.  Acupuncture can support men as they age and eliminate symptoms and signs related to MM.
