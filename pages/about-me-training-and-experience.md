### Acupuncture Training

I trained at one of Europe’s most respected schools of Acupuncture, the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM) in Reading where  I was  mentored by some of the most respected and experienced Acupuncturists in the UK. You can find out more about this excellent college [here](https://www.acupuncturecollege.org.uk/).

I have an integrated training in two of the main schools of  Acupuncture treatment, Five Element and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), these different approaches have differing strengths. Having an integrated training allows me to combine the best of both approaches to achieve the excellent and wide ranging improvements in well-being for which proper Traditional Chinese Acupuncture is known.

### Academic Qualifications:
  *BSc (Hons) in Acupuncture

* LicAc (Licentiate in Acupuncture)
– This is the formal Traditional Acupuncture qualification in the UK, it signifies that I have undertaken degree level training in Acupuncture and, most importantly, Chinese Medical theory. 

* BA (Hons) in Psychology

I am a member of the British Acupuncture Council, the largest regulatory body for Acupuncturists in the UK. 


### Specialist Paediatric Training
1. The treatment of children and young people is a particular passion of mine. It is distinct from the treatment of adults and requires extensive additional training.  I have completed additional specialist training in the treatment of babies and children with Julian Scott who is one of the worlds foremost experts in Paediatric Acupuncture.
2.I have also completed additional specialist training in the treatment of Teenagers and young people with Rebecca Avern who is an international author in the subject and the Paediatric course director at the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine.

### Additional Fertility Training
As well as extensive personal study and my clinical experience I have completed specialist fertility training with Jane Lyttleton who is one of the worlds foremost authorities on Acupuncture for fertility.
 
### First Aid
I have a current qualified clinic first aid qualification.

I run a general practise treating a full range of conditions but have specialist training and experience in:
