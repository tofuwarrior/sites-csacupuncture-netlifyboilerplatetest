### Acupuncture Training

I studied for my Degree & Licentiate in Acupuncture for 4 years at one of Europe’s most respected schools of Acupuncture, the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM) in Reading where  I was  mentored by some of the most experienced Acupuncturists in the UK. You can find out more about this excellent college [here](https://www.acupuncturecollege.org.uk/).

I have an integrated training in the two main schools of thinking in authentic Traditional Chinese Acupuncture , 'Five Element Constitutional and 'Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)', these different approaches have differing strengths. Having an integrated training allows me to combine the best of both approaches to achieve the excellent and wide ranging improvements in well-being for which proper Traditional Chinese Acupuncture is known.

### Academic Qualifications:
* BSc (Hons) 2.1 in Acupuncture

* LicAc (Licentiate in Acupuncture)
– This is the formal Traditional Acupuncture qualification in the UK, it signifies that I have undertaken degree level training in Acupuncture and, most importantly, Chinese Medical theory. 

* BA (Hons) 2.1 in Psychology

I am a member of the British Acupuncture Council, the largest regulatory body for authentic Traditional Acupuncturists in the UK. 


### Specialist Paediatric Training
  1. The treatment of children and young people is a particular passion of mine. It is distinct from the treatment of adults and requires substantial additional training.  I have completed my additional training in the treatment of babies and children with Julian Scott who is one of the worlds foremost experts in Paediatric Acupuncture.
  2. I completed additional training in the treatment of Teenagers and young people with Rebecca Avern who is an international author on the subject and the Paediatric course director at the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine.

### Additional Fertility Training
As well as extensive personal study and my clinical experience I have completed specialist fertility training with Jane Lyttleton who is one of the worlds foremost authorities on Acupuncture for fertility.
 
### First Aid
I have a current qualified clinic first aid qualification.

## Experience 
Having qualified in 2012 I have been treating people with Acupuncture continually since then and have treated hundreds of people of all ages ranging from 6 months to 92.

I am a full time, specialist Acupuncturist so I apply the full depth of Acupuncture knowledge, I do not use a simplified form Acupuncture as an add on to another therapy.  

While I run a busy general practise treating a full range of both physical and emotional conditions I also have specialist training and experience in:
1. the treatment of babies, children & teenagers and the 
2. treatment of fertility related issues

**These are both areas which require specialist knowledge above and beyond that in an Acupuncture degree**
