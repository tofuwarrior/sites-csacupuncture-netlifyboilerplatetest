  Anxiety can be one of the more overwhelming emotional states. I have treated many people struggling with anxiety over the years and I've noticed that it is very common for people to feel that they should be able to just 'snap out of it' or just to be able to change how they feel through willpower alone.  If you are feeling like this then I hope reading this will help you to take some pressure off yourself, when you are feeling anxious it is often because there are high levels of stress hormones in your system, that is why you are feeling the way you are and it is a big ask to expect yourself to just change how you are feeling through willpower alone.  It is absolutely possible to engage in helpful practises that can help your body calm down like Tai chi, Yoga or Meditation, exercise or cutting down caffeine and changing diet but it is uncommon for these to work like some kind of magic bullet, they tend to help more gradually.

Acupuncture is excellent and helping us deal with all sorts of emotional states and helps many people get you out of the vicious circle of Anxiety allowing us to feel calm once again.

### How Can It Help?
The quick answer is that good Acupuncture treats you the person aswell as any symptoms you have and when treatmenht supports you in this way, you feel better at both deep and surface levels. The way we experience our emotional and mental life is just is as much related to the conditions in our physical body as it is to what is happening in our mind and Acupuncture helps to balance things at all levels. Research has shown that Acupuncture affects our hormonal and nervous systems aswell as more tangible aspects of our body, all of these things influence our emotional state. Treatment brings you back into a better balance, it encourages the body’s natural tendency to operate at optimum health and emotional wellbeing is a product of this. People start reporting feeling 'more myself’, ‘more resilient’, ‘more content’ etc. This is the real meaning of well-being and one of the things that is amazing, and to some, surprising, about Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, is that it can help you get back to feel this way.

It is this aspect of Acupuncture more than any other that inspired me to commit to studying for 4 years to be an Acupuncturist.  Experiencing what it felt like to feel so better in myself inspired me to want to be able to share that with others.


### Who Can Benefit?
I would say that the majority of people can probably benefit. Since I qualified in 2012, I can only think of a handful of people who have come to me with emotional issues who haven't felt much much better after a relatively short course of treatment.


### What Do I Need to Do?
If you have something that is getting in the way of you feeling like the real you then you can either [book an appointment](/how-to-book.html) or [get in touch](#contact-trigger) and we can chat about what is giving you difficulty and whether Acupuncture might be able to help. The majority of people find it leaves them feeling much better, whether they ‘believe’ in Acupuncture or not.
