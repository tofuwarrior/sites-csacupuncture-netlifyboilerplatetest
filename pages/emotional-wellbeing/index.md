  People who have a course of Acupuncture treatment  often comment that aswell as their specific complaint being better, they feel much better in themselves.

### How can It Help?
  The quick answer is that good Acupuncture treats all of you and when you nourish yourself in this way you feel better at both deep and surface levels. The way we experience our emotional and mental life is just as much related to our physical body as whether we have a bad back; just see how your feelings change when you are ill or tired or under stress.

  Acupuncture treatment brings you back into a better balance, it encourages the body’s natural tendency to operate at optimum health and emotional wellbeing is a product of this. Good Acupuncture treatment balances you and one of the results of this is that patients start reporting feeling 'more myself’, ‘more resilient’, ‘more content’ etc. This is the real meaning of well-being and what is amazing, and surprising about Traditional Acupuncture is that it can help you feel this way.

  It is this aspect of Acupuncture more than any other that inspired me to commit to a demanding 4 year training.  Experiencing what it felt like to feel so much better in myself inspired me to want to be able to share that with others.


### Who Can Benefit?
  In my experience, most people. Since I qualified in 2012, I can only think of a handful of people who have come to me with emotional issues who haven't felt much much better after a relatively short course of treatment.

  Everyone has different kinds of demands that life brings to them, Acupuncture for many people is a useful tool that helps them live life more fully rather than ending up surviving it.

### What Do I Need to Do?
  If you have something that is getting in the way of you feeling like the real you then you can either [book an appointment](/how-to-book.html) or [get in touch](#contact-trigger) and we can chat about what is giving you difficulty and whether Acupuncture might be able to help. The majority of people find it leaves them feeling much better, whether they ‘believe’ in Acupuncture or not.
