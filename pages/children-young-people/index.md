<p>In treating adults I quickly learned that some of their long standing health problems had their beginnings as something less serious in their childhood or adolescence. I realised that if I treated children then, while I and they wouldn't know which of them had problems that would become bigger later in life, by treating children, as well as helping them immediately, some would be saved from chronic illness later on and have fundamentally better adult lives as a consequence.<br>
    Children and young people so well to Acupuncture, often more quickly than adults, and so it is a gentle choice that helps address problems in childhood that we often assume cannot be helped and it stops small problems becoming the start of something more long lasting. 
    <br>This is why I am so passionate about treating children and young people.

    When you become a parent you understand first hand the incredible depth of just how much we love our children. I bring that passion, sensitivity and care to all of my pediatric patients.

<h3>Additional Training</h3>
<p>The treatment of children is one of my 2 specialisms, the other being the treatment of fertility. <br/>
As well as my years of accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have completed extensive additional pediatric training, completing specialist training in treating babies, children and also teenagers, with both Julian Scott and Rebecca Avern who are both world recognised pediatric practitioners.
I continually develop my treatment of children as an active member of paediatric Acupuncture communities.
