  In treating adults I quickly learned that some people's long standing health problems had their beginnings as something much less serious in their childhood or adolescence. I realised that if I treated children then, in some, I would be stopping problems that, for some, could blight their adult life. This is why I am particularly passionate about treating children and young people.

  The first child I treated was my son.  He developed a very painful and worsening ear infection when he was 2 1/2, I treated him in the evening, by the following morning he was much improved, I treated him again and by the evening it had completely cleared. I am used to Acupuncture producing great changes for people but I was quite astonished, it was my first experience of just how amazing Acupuncture can be for children. <br/>No drugs, no antibiotics, just 4 tiny needles, twice.

  Children and young people respond exceptionally well to Acupuncture, often very rapidly like my son, and often with minimal treatment. Younger children often don't even need needles, other treatment methods being options, but almost all children accept Acupuncture treatment.  It is a gentle choice that resolves problems without the harmful side-effects of some medications.

  > If you are a parent or guardian you will understand first hand, the depth of how much we love our children. I bring that passion, sensitivity and care to all of my young patients and those who care for them.
