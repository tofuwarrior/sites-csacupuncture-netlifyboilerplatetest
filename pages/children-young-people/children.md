## Children
Children are very responsive to Acupuncture.  Because they are so young, their system has often not had enough time to get stuck out of balance so for many they need very minimal treatment to achieve a significant improvement. 

It is not widely known that Children's Acupuncture is often able to gently resolve many of the issues of childhood that we assume just have to be accepted.
The majority of children happily accept Acupuncture treatment and for some children other Acupuncture treatment methods are often highly effective so in many cases they don't need needles.

### Acupuncture helps many aspects of children's wellbeing but issues I commonly help are:
* Digestive problems
* Appetite issues & picky eating
* Allergies
* Problems with sleeping
* Pain
* Skin issues
* Asthma
* Behavioural difficulties

### If the thing your child is having difficulty with is not in this list...
> It doesn't mean Acupuncture can't help them; this list is only examples of common problems I see. If you want to discover whether Acupuncture can help them, get in touch using any of the methods at the bottom of this page and we can explore whether Acupuncture might be a good choice to help your child.
