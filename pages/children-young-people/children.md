<p>
Children are very responsive to Acupuncture so often need very little treatment. Because they are so young, their system has not had enough time to get stuck out of balance so for many they also tend to experience a complete cure to their condition.</p>

<p>
It is not widely known that Children's Acupuncture is often able to gently resolve many of the issues of childhood that we assume just have to be accepted.
The majority of children happily accept Acupuncture treatment and for some children other Acupuncture treatment methods are often highly effective so in many cases they don't need needles.

<h3>Acupuncture can help many aspects of children's wellbeing but issues I commonly help are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Digestive problems</li>
    <li>Appetite issues & picky eating</li>
    <li>Allergies</li>
    <li>Problems with sleeping</li>
     <li>Pain</li>
    <li>Skin issues</li>
    <li>Asthma</li>
    <li>Behavioural difficulties</li>
</ul> 

<blockquote>
If the area your child is having difficulty is not in this brief list, it doesn't mean Acupuncture can't help it, these are only examples of common problems. Just get in touch and we can explore whether Acupuncture might be able to help your child.
