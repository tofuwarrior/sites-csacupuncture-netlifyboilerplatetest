<p>
We all are aware that our teenage years involve a lot of challenges. 
These years are characterised by very rapid and profound changes in our bodies but also in the structure and activity in the brain.
It is very very common for teenagers to suffer with emotional or with physical issues as they learn to adapt to these fundamental changes.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, in the modern world these challenges are often made more difficult.
The modern world has increased electronic stimulation, more intense social and academic expectations and other lifestyle issues such as, lack of sleep and the poor quality of food in our modern society. 
All of these make it harder for teenagers to thrive and as a consequence teenagers now have very high levels of physical and emotional distress.

<p>
Being young means that Teenagers and young people generally, don't need lots of treatment. 
Acupuncture brings balance to our bodies and our emotions providing relief from from a whole array of the challenges associated with our teenage years.
