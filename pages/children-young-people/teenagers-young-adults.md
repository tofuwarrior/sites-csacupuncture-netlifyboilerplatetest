## Teenagers & young Adults
Our teenage years are characterised by rapid and profound changes in our bodies but also in the structure and activity in the brain.

It is very common for teenagers to experience emotional or physical issues as they adapt to these fundamental changes.

Unfortunately, in the modern world these challenges are often made more difficult.
The modern world has increased electronic stimulation, more intense social and academic expectations and other lifestyle issues such as, lack of sleep and the poor quality of food in our modern society. 
All of these make it harder for teenagers to thrive and as a consequence teenagers now have higher levels of physical and emotional distress.

I have a particular passion for treating teenagers and children because treatment early in life sets the scene for good health later in life rather than imbalances turiing into more chronic problems as adults.  I have completed specialist training specific to helping Teenagers; I did this with Rebecca Avern who is an internationally recognised author and educator in this field. I also a member of specialist Acupuncture practitioner groups focused on the treatment of children.
 
Acupuncture gently brings balance to our systems and consequently our emotions and physical symptoms are relieved. 

### Acupuncture influences many bodily systems but issues I commonly help teenagers and young people with are:
<ul>
    <li>Emotional distress like anxiety, depression and irritability</li>
    <li>Injuries and muscular pain</li>
    <li>Skin issues like Acne</li>    
    <li>Digestive problems</li>
    <li>Menstrual cycle difficulties</li>
    <li>Appetite issues</li>
    <li>Allergies</li>
    <li>Problems with sleeping</li>
     <li>Migraines & headaches</li>
    <li>Asthma</li>
</ul> 

  > If the area you, or the young person you care for, is having difficulty with is not in this brief list, it doesn't mean Acupuncture can't help it, these are only examples of common problems. Just get in touch and we can explore whether Acupuncture might be able to help.
