  Traditional Acupuncture is a complete system of diagnosis and treatment and as such is used to treat a very wide range of health conditions, too many to list. It is used to treat both humans but vets also use it to treat animals. 

  Aswell as being very effective for Adults, treating a very wide range of conditions, Acupuncture is also particularly effective for babies, children and teenagers. Treatment of younger children and babies often does not require needles but when it does, almost all children will happily accept Acupuncture treatment.

  Acupuncture treats a wide variety physical health issues but also can help us emotionally. It is usually possible to achieve both at the same time so my clients often report more personal effects like feeling more energised, content, confident, relaxed etc.  Many people come specifically for help with issues relating to their emotions.

  Below you can find details on some common areas for which Acupuncture is used. If you are unsure whether it might be able to help you, please [contact me](#contact-trigger){: .contact-trigger} using any of the methods at the bottom of this page. If Acupuncture would not be helpful, I can normally suggest another reliable professional in the area who might be able to help.
