### You can either: 

[**Book Here**](#booking-form){:.booking-trigger .button .small} to use the **simple online booking system on this page**, OR 

[**Contact me**](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger .button .small} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page.

**If you can't make any of the clinic slots I have available, please get in contact, when it is really difficult for people to attend treatment I am sometimes able to get additional clinic space.**

### Not sure what kind of consultation you need?...
[For more detail on these different consultation types click here.](/about-acupuncture/consultation-types.html)

* There are **separate appointments for under 13s**, choose one of these if you are booking a child in.

* If you **aren't sure whether Acupuncture is the right choice for you** then the quickest thing is just to [contact me](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page and we can have a chat. OR, book the 'Exploratory Consultation'

* If you **know you want Acupuncture treatment but haven't yet had any treatment with me** then book the 'Full Initial Consultation'

* If you or your child have **already had treatment with me** and are booking another session then book the 'Follow-up Treatment'

 <h2>COVID-19 SECURE PRACTISE</h2>
 <p><b>Professional Acupuncturists are currently allowed to practise.</b> I will need you to self-certify a list of COVID-19 questions the day before your appointment. You must not attend if you develop any COVID-19 symptoms or are in contact with anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms. You will needs to wear a mask during your appointmen. If you cannot wear a mask because of health reasons, please get in touch and let me know so we can make arrangements.  </p> <a href="/covid-how-i-keep-you-safe.html" class="button">Read the full covid-19 safety measures I am following here.</a>
