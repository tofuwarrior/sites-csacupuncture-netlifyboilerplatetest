### You can either: 

[**Book Here**](#booking-form){:.booking-trigger .button .small} to use the **simple online booking system on this page**, OR 

[**Contact me**](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger .button .small} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page.

**If you can't make any of the clinic slots I have available, please get in contact, when it is really difficult for people to attend treatment I am sometimes able to get additional clinic space.**

### Not sure what kind of consultation you need?...
[For more detail on these different consultation types click here.](/about-acupuncture/consultation-types.html)

* There are **separate appointments for under 13s**, make sure you pick one of these if you are booking a child in.

* If you **aren't sure whether Acupuncture is the right choice for you** then the quickest thing is just to [contact me](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page and we can have a chat. OR, book the 'Exploratory Consultation'

* If you **know you want Acupuncture treatment but haven't yet had any treatment with me** then book the 'Full Initial Consultation'

* If you or your child have **already had treatment with me** and are booking another session then book the 'Follow-up Treatment'

 <h2>COVID-19 SECURE PRACTISE</h2>
 <p><b>Since the COVID-19 lockdown all Acupuncturists have been required to pause treating to prevent transmission of the virus.</b>
<br> I know that this is difficult for you, you need help, and I want to help you. Below you can read the ways in which I can help you self-treat, information about how the practise will be COVID secure when I am open again. If you want to know when I will be open again, contact me so I can let you know when I re-open.</p> <a href="/covid-how-i-keep-you-safe.html" class="button">Read the full covid-19 safety measures I am following here.</a>

           
<h2>Can Help You Now?</h2>
<p> Since lockdown, I have been diagnosing people remotely over video chat or the phone and, where appropriate, guiding people in self-treatment using **Acupressure, Chinese Medical Massage and instruction in Tai Chi movements**, the combination of these methods addresses a wide range of physical and emotional conditions and gives you tools you can use at home.<br/>
 This has been very effective in most cases where we have tried it but some conditions need Acupuncture alone and in those situations we have booked ahead for when the clinic is likely to open.</p>                                      
<p><b>You can explore whether I can help you self treat now, just book a free, no obligation, exploratory consultation below.</b></p>
