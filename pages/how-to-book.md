## How To Book

You can either use the simple online booking system on this page, OR contact me using any of the methods at the bottom of the page.
If you can't make any of the clinic slots I have available, please get in contact, when it is genuinely difficult for people to attend treatment I am sometimes able to get additional clinic space.

### Not sure what kind of consultation you need?...

* If you aren't sure whether Acupuncture is the right choice for you then the quickest thing is just to contact me using any of the methods at the bottom of the page and we can have a chat.

* If you aren't sure whether Acupuncture is the right choice for you but you want to come in to speak with me in person, book the 'Exploratory Consultation'

* If you know you want Acupuncture treatment but haven't yet had any treatment then book the 'Full Initial Consultation'

* If you have already had treatment and are booking another session then book the 'Followup Treatment
