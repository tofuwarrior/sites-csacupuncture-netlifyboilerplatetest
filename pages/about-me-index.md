  I provide individualised, patient-centred treatments that are focused on addressing what matters to you. In both my personal and professional life, I believe in nourishing people from the inside out and forming long lasting relationships based on trust, integrity and commitment.

As well as providing treatment using Acupuncture I am also trained in the use of Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Chinese Cupping, Moxibustion and Guasha, these are additional treatment methods that can enhance Acupuncture for certain issues and conditions. 

  I also have a degree in Psychology from Cardiff University.
  
  From 2017 until recently, I was a founding director and Vice-Chairman of Evidence Based Acupuncture.
  Evidence Based Acupuncture is a US based charity that works to improve health outcomes for members of the public by communicating where and how the scientific evidence relating to Acupuncture shows Acupuncture to be a better or safer treatment than existing treatment options.
