  My name is Paul Burdon. I am a degree qualified, authentic Traditional Acupuncturist. I provide individualised, patient-centred treatments that are focused on addressing what matters to you. In both my personal and professional life, I believe in nourishing people from the inside out and forming long lasting relationships based on trust, integrity and commitment.

I am a full member of the British Acupuncture Council (BAcC) The BAcC is the largest governing body for Acupuncturists in the UK. Membership of the BAcC gives you complete confidence that I am trained to the highest standards in Chinese Medicine theory and diagnosis and treatment using Acupuncture, that I engage in continuing professional study and that I am fully insured.

  From 2017 until 2019, I was a founding director and Vice-Chairman of Evidence Based Acupuncture.
