  I am a Degree qualified Traditional Acupuncturist and a full member of the British Acupuncture Council which is the largest body governing for Acupuncturists in the UK, this means I am trained to the highest standards in Chinese Medicine theory and diagnosis as well as treatment using Acupuncture. As well as providing treatment using Acupuncture I am also trained in the use of Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Chinese Cupping, Moxibustion and Guasha, these are additional treatment methods that can enhance Acupuncture for certain issues and conditions. 

  I also have a degree in Psychology from Cardiff University.
  
  Until recently, I was Vice-Chairman and a founding director of Evidence Based Acupuncture.
  Evidence Based Acupuncture is a US based charity that works to improve health outcomes for members of the public by communicating where and how the scientific evidence relating to Acupuncture shows Acupuncture to be a better or safer treatment than existing treatment options.
