<h2>Can I Treat You Now?</h2>
 
<p> All Acupuncture practises have to be closed until lockdown is lifted, I know this is difficult for you because you need help and I want to help you! For some situations I am able to support you to learn self-treatment methods other than Acupuncture. This has been very successful see below for how you can find out if this is an option with a free consultation.</p>

<h2 id="self_treatment">Guided Self-Treatment during Lockdown</h2> 

<p> Traditional Acupuncture is part of a much wider set of medical techniques including Acupressure, Chinese Medical Massage(Tui Na), and Tai Chi exercises (Qi Gong). In addition  dietary advice and lifestyle advice are important ways in which I help people resolve many physical and emotional difficulties.  I am trained in all these techniques and have 20 years experience of Tai Chi practise.

During lockdown I have been carrying out full consultations over video chat or the phone and, where appropriate, guiding people in self-treatment using Acupressure, Chinese Medical Massage and instruction in Tai Chi movement as well as advice. The combination of these methods has successfully helped a range of physical and emotional conditions.
It is not always appropriate, some conditions need Acupuncture and only Acupuncture will do, in these situations we have booked ahead for when the clinic is likely to open.</p>

<h2>When Will I Be Able To Treat You With Acupuncture?</h2>
<p>The practise is already fully prepared with professional grade personal protective equipment (PPE) and official COVID-secure working practises for safe re-opening. When Welsh government release the lockdown I will be starting work immediately. I can let you know when I am opening, <a href="#contact-trigger" class="contact-trigger">click here to see my contact details</a> let me know you want to know when I can help you and I will let you know when I can start back.
