Traditional Acupuncture is a form of medicine that has been developed and refined for over 2000 years, it originated in China and the East but, its excellent safety and effectiveness have meant that, in more recent years it has spread to be used all over the world. In China and many other countries it is used in hospitals in conjunction with conventional medicine for the front-line treatment of acute and chronic injuries and illness. In the UK proper Traditional (Chinese) Acupuncture is only occasionally available through the NHS and is more usually accessed by visiting a qualified independent practitioner. 

Traditional Acupuncture uses the principles of Chinese Medicine to diagnose characteristic unhelpful patterns in a person's health that are leading to problems. Correcting these patterns addresses the root cause of the symptoms so they cease to be an issue. The process of Acupuncture Treatment involves stimulating specific points in the body, this is most commonly achieved using the insertion of very fine needles but can also be achieved using other treatments such as Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Acupressure, Chinese Cupping, Guasha and Moxibustion.
