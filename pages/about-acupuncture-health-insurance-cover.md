This list is a work in progress because policies change and I cannot keep up with all the changes so it is not a comprehensive list.  If your insurer is not listed then please contact them. Some insurers or health plans require you to use an Acupuncturist that is a member of the British Acupuncture Council, I am. If you contact your scheme and find you are covered please let me know and I can add the details to this list to help others in the future.
