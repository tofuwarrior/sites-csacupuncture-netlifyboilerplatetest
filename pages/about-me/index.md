As well as providing treatment using Acupuncture I am also trained in the use of Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Chinese Cupping, Moxibustion and Guasha, these are additional treatment methods that work well in harmony with Acupuncture and are very effective for more specific issues and conditions.
