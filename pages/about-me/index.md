  I am a Degree qualified Traditional Acupuncturist and a full member of the British Acupuncture Council, this means I am trained in Chinese Medicine theory and diagnosis as well as treatment using Acupuncture. As well as providing treatment using Acupuncture I am also trained in the use of Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Chinese Cupping, Moxibustion and Guasha, these are additional treatment methods that work well in harmony with Acupuncture and are very effective for more specific issues and conditions. I also have a degree in Psychology from Cardiff University.
  
  Until 2018, I was Vice-Chairman and a founding director of Evidence Based Acupuncture.
  Evidence Based Acupuncture is a US based charity, they work to improve health outcomes for members of the public by communicating where and how the scientific evidence relating to Acupuncture shows Acupuncture to be a better or safer treatment than existing treatment options.
