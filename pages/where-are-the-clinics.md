** I have recently moved to Pembrokeshire and am practising in Goodwick near Fishguard. If you have seen me in Cardiff and are needing more treatment, please do get in touch, I love hearing from my past patients, and I will be very happy to recommend some good people in Cardiff who can help you.**

**My main clinic day is currently Wednesday, as the practise grows I will add more days.At the moment, depending on the availability of clinic space, I am able to be fairly flexible.**
