 People can sometimes feel awkward about fertility issues and while this is a normal way to feel, it's also important to recognise that issues with fertility are now very common and are often not to do with you personally; sperm counts in western men have halved in the last 40 years decreasing by 1.4% per year. Although the causes are not clearly understood by science, issues such as increased environmental toxins, modern diets and stress from modern lifestyles are all seen as being significant factors. Acupuncture has a variety of ways to understand the problem and treatment to make a difference.

### What Treatment Has to Offer
Acupuncture has a well deserved scientific reputation for making a significant difference to both men and women when it comes to helping fertility. 
Studies have shown statistically significant increases in motility and quality of sperm. 
Since 2000, a number of studies have examined the effect of acupuncture on male fertility, with encouraging results. A 2005 study published in Fertility and Sterility, a leading peer-reviewed journal for reproductive medicine, found that a course of 10 acupuncture treatments over 5 weeks led to statistically significant increases in both motility and normal sperm in infertile men. To date, several smaller studies have produced similar results.

Research has demonstrated that good Acupuncture treatment has the effect of increasing blood flow to the testicular artery and so results in cooling the scrotum. What does this mean for you? Your testicles need blood to transport nutrients, remove waste products that can damage sperm while they mature and maintain the ideal temperature for sperm to grow healthily. Unfortunately, too many guys are walking around with poor blood flow in the scrotum.  This imbalance can cause accumulation of waste products from the body, poor sperm production, and even conditions like varicocele. It can also impair the ability of the body to keep the temperature just right.

This is just one example but illustrates how authentic Acupuncture identifies potential problems that might be impacting your fertility and has treatment that can help.

### Specialist Training
The treatment of fertility is one of my 2 specialisms, the other being the treatment of children.
As well as my years of accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed specialist additional training with world renowned fertility expert Jane Lyttleton, I also engage in continuing additional learning.


### What Treatment Involves
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to what is important to you, this involves acupuncture treatment but also often can involve advice about adjustments that could be made in daily life to help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand the problem and resolve it naturally. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles, there is very little or no discomfort and don't worry, **there will be no needles going anywhere near your testicles or penis!**
