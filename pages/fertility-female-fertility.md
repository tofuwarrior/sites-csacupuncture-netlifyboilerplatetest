## Acupuncture for Women's Fertility
 Many women and men experience fertility issues and although the causes are not always fully understood, issues such as waiting longer to have a child, increased environmental toxins, modern diets and stress or pressures from modern lifestyles can all be significant factors as well as any indvidual issues. Difficulties conceiving or carrying a pregnancy can be immensely distressing but, sadly, are also common so please remember you are not alone. 
Acupuncture may be able to help you, just as it has helped many thousands of women before you. Please feel free to get in touch to talk about your situation. It is very important to me that you are able to freely explore whether Acupuncture feels right for you so there is no cost or obligation.

### What Treatment Has to Offer
Acupuncture has an established scientific reputation for increasing the success rates of people trying for a baby. 
Fertility is a complex issue, with many factors involved so the holistic approach of Acupuncture, looking at the whole of you and treating you as a whole person with individualised personal treatment, is often very.

Acupuncture frequently resolves fertility issues without additional medical treatment but if you are considering or undergoing assisted reproduction therapy (IVF, IUI, ICSI etc), it has much to offer to increase the chances of success and also to help you cope with the side-effects of this kind of medical treatment.

  If you have been struggling to get pregnant it can sometimes be because something quite minor is not quite right in your body and for some a simple course of treatment or some simple lifestyle adjustments is enough to tip the balance. I have had plenty of patients over the years where they have got pregnant shortly after starting a course of Acupuncture and most people know of someone who got pregnant when they reduced their workload or changed their diet. This is because sometimes it is a relatively small thing that is stopping pregnancy happening. More commonly though it takes a little more time and for some even though we see positive changes in fertility indicators they opt to combine the positive effects of Acupuncture with Assisted Reproduction Therapy.

These are all personal decisions which I support you in making with emotional support and advice.

### My Fertility Experience & Training
  As well as accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed extensive additional fertility training delivered by Jane Lyttleton who is an internationally respected author and educator in the field of Acupuncture and fertility.  I have been helping both male and female patients with fertility related issues since 2013.


### What Treatment Involves
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to you, this involves Acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments you can make in daily life that will help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand what might be blocking your fertility and resolve it naturally. 

Each time I see you, we review how you have been since the last appointment, look for signs of improvement and decide whether our current approach to treatment is still the best for you or whether we should make any adjustments. Each treatment is individual and tailored to how you are on the day I see you.

### Emotional Support
  Struggling to conceive, especially when going through assisted reproduction treatment or when pregnancies have been lost, can be very distressing. Providing you with empathy, understanding and a total, authentic, acceptance of your feelings, is central to how I support you as my patient. The desire to become a parent is one of the deepest human desires; I recognise and honour this with the deepest commitment to supporting you in every way I can.
