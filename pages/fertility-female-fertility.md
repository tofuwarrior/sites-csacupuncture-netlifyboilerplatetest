 Many women and men experience fertility issues and although the causes are not always fully understood, issues such as waiting longer to have a child, increased environmental toxins, modern diets and stress or pressures from modern lifestyles can all be significant factors as well as any indvidual issues. Difficulties conceiving or carrying a pregnancy can be immensely distressing but, sadly, are also common so please remember you are not alone. 
Acupuncture may be able to help you, just as it has helped many thousands of women before you. Please feel free to get in touch to talk about your situation. It is very important to me that you are able to freely explore whether Acupuncture feels right for you so there is no cost or obligation.

### What Treatment Has to Offer
  Acupuncture has been shown to increase the rates of pregnancy in couples trying for a baby.  Sometimes it can be helpful for both partners in a couple to receive Acupuncture as Acupuncture can positively affect both male and female fertility. If you have been struggling to get pregnant, it can sometimes be because something relatively minor is happening in your system and for some, a simple course of treatment, possibly with some lifestyle changes, is enough to let pregnancy happen. Over the years I have seen many patients where they have got pregnant after a course of Acupuncture. While these 'quick wins' are common enough, sometimes it takes a little more time and nurturing of your body to bring you to your best. For some, even though we see positive changes in fertility indicators we opt to utilise the positive effects Acupuncture has with Assisted Reproduction Therapy (IVF, IUI etc). There is no one way that is right, these are personal decisions that I can support you to make.

### My Fertility Experience & Training
  As well as accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed extensive additional fertility training delivered by Jane Lyttleton who is an internationally respected author and educator in the field of Acupuncture and fertility.  I have been helping both male and female patients with fertility related issues since 2013.

### What Treatment Involves
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to you, this involves Acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments you can make in daily life that will help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand what might be blocking your fertility and resolve it naturally. 

Each time I see you, we review how you have been since the last appointment, look for signs of improvement and decide whether our current approach to treatment is still the best for you or whether we should make any adjustments. Each treatment is individual and tailored to how you are on the day I see you.

### Emotional Support
  Struggling to conceive, especially when going through assisted reproduction treatment or when pregnancies have been lost, can be very distressing. Providing you with empathy, understanding and a total, authentic, acceptance of your feelings, is central to how I support you as my patient. The desire to become a parent is one of the deepest human desires; I recognise and honour this with the deepest commitment to supporting you in every way I can.

### Assisted Reproduction (IVF, IUI, ICSI etc)
**Acupuncture frequently resolves fertility issues without additional medical treatment** but not always.  If you are considering or undergoing assisted reproduction therapy (IVF, IUI, ICSI etc), it has still has much to offer to increase the chances of success and also to help you cope with, what can be unwelcome physical or emotional side-effects of this kind of medical treatment.

#### Assisted Reproduction (IVF, IUI, ICSI etc) Support

There are a number of options for Acupuncture when undergoing Assisted Reproductive Therapy, which you choose depends to some degree on the level to which you want assistance.
 Acupuncture is best received for a few months before starting the ART, this helps  and then during treatment.

Regular acupuncture is recommended  until you are 12 weeks pregnant.  As well as increasing the chances of pregnancy, treatment is also designed to support you emotionally at this demanding time.

### Support In Pregnancy

Unfortunately, pregnancy often does always not involve, ‘glowing’. Difficulties are common as your body undergoes such a significant change. Acupuncture is an exceptionally safe form of medicine both for you and your baby and helps to address many common issues in pregnancy.
