## Pain
Acupuncture is excellent at reducing or removing the sensation of pain.

Although, as a complete system of medicine, it treats a very wide range of conditions it is best known in the west for treating pain. In fact NICE (the UK body who determine best practise) recently stated that research shows Acupuncture to be the only form of treatment, conventional or complementary that effectively treats tension headaches or migraine.  In addition they identified that over prescription of medication is one of the most common causes of these kinds of headaches.
The report can be viewed here: http://publications.nice.org.uk/headaches-cg150/guidance

Acupuncture does not just treat headaches, it is well known for helping alleviate the sensation of lower back pain and other conditions.

If you are currently troubled by pain then it is very likely that I can help you, as well as Acupuncture I am also trained in Tui Na (CHiense therapeutic massage), Guasha and Cupping which are all Chinese medical skills intended to help with pain as well as other issues.

People sometimes come to Acupuncture as a last resort after they have failed to find help elsewhere and even in these situations where a condition has got worse because of a lack of effective treatment,  there is often a lot that can be done to help.

As well as treating your condition directly, I can often  help your ability to deal with your condition as well because Acupuncture can treat more than one aspect of your health at once.
##Physical Health
As an example, patient’s who are experiencing side effects from chemotherapy often find Acupuncture helpful. There is no evidence that Acupuncture helps cancer itself but it does affect many of the common side effects of chemotherapy like Nausea and headaches and so can produce very substantial changes in quality of life.

Of course, just like other systems of medicine, Acupuncture cannot help everything, so one of the first things I do when we speak is find out about what is troubling you so that I can make an assessment of how likely it is I can help you, this helps you make a realistic decision about whether you want treatment. If I can’t help you then I can suggest other reliable, professional practitioners in the local area who may be able to.

Life is of course, for living and by helping your body help itself Acupuncture helps you do that.
