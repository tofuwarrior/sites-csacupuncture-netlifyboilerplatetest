## What Is Acupuncture?

Traditional Acupuncture is a form of medicine that has been developed and refined for over 2000 years, it originated in China but, due to its excellent safety and effectiveness, in more recent years it has spread to be used all over the world. In China it is used in hospitals in conjunction with conventional medicine for the front-line treatment of acute and chronic injuries and illness. In the UK proper Traditional (Chinese) Acupuncture is only occasionally available through the NHS and is more usually accessed by visiting a qualified practitioner such as me. 

Traditional Acupuncture uses the principles of Chinese Medicine to diagnose the patterns of imbalance in a person that are leading to illness. Treatment involves stimulating specific points in the body, this is most commonly achieved using the insertion of very fine needles but can also be achieved using other treatments such as Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), Acupressure, Cupping, Guasha and Moxa.
