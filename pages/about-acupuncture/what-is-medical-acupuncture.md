## What is Medical Acupuncture?

Medical Acupuncture is a more limited form of Acupuncture that is useful for many muscle and joint problems. It is different to Traditional Acupuncture which is the form of Acupuncture which has been practised in China for over 2000 years.

A Medical Acupuncturist is someone who has done a course for a few days learning how to insert Acupuncture needles into specific points, this is usually in order to help with forms of pain. 

The fact that so many professions find even this simplified version of Acupuncture more effective, for some conditions, than their main training does demonstrate what a great treatment Acupncture is.

> Medical Acupuncture helps many people but, if you have had Medical Acupuncture and it did not help you, it is likely that you could still be helped by Traditional Acupuncture because, although both involve the insertion of needles, Medical and Traditional Acupuncture are very different systems of medicine, medical Acupuncturists are not taught all the different functions of the Acupuncture points or how to use these in relation to the wide range of illnesses we, as people, can experience.

Although some conventional practitioners do commit to the lengthy training required to practise Traditional Acupuncture, most donâ€™t so if you have had Acupuncture administered by a Doctor, Physiotherapist, Chiropractor, Osteopath or other similarly trained conventional medical practitioner you have probably had Medical, not Traditional Acupuncture. A Traditional Acupuncturist will usually say they are a Traditional Acupuncturist or will say they practise TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), 5 Elements or Japanese Acupuncture.

A Traditional Acupuncturist has engaged in an extensive (usually over a number of years), course of study of Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture theory and is equipped to make a Chinese Medical diagnosis of your current health picture. It is this ability to determine the Chinese Medical diagnosis  and then, on the basis of this, to select the best Acupuncture points to address imbalances in your body that allows a Traditional Acupuncturist to treat a wide range of physical and mental/emotional issues and to treat multiple issues at once.
