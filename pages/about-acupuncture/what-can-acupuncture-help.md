  Traditional Acupuncture is a complete system of diagnosis and treatment and as such is used to treat a very wide range of health conditions, too many to list. It is used to treat both humans but vets also use it to treat animals. 

  While it is very effective for Adults and can treat a very wide range of conditions, Acupuncture is exceptionally effective for babies, children and teenagers. Treatment of younger children and babies often does not require needles but when it does, almost all children will happily accept Acupuncture treatment. I have a particular passion, and specialised training in the treatment of children. 

  As well as physical health benefits,  Acupuncture treatment also helps people feel better emotionally, so my clients often report more personal effects like feeling more energised, content, confident, relaxed etc Many people come to be specifically for help with issues relating to their emotions.
