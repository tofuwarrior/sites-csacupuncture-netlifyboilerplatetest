## What Can Acupuncture Help?

Traditional Acupuncture is a complete system of diagnosis and treatment and as such is used to treat a very wide range of health conditions, too many to list. It is used to treat both humans but vets also use it to treat animals. 

While it is very effective for Adults, Acupuncture is particularly effective for babies children and teenagers , this is because younger people are generally more reactive to treatment. I have specialised training in the treatment of children. 

If you are unsure whether it might be able to help you then please contact me using the details below for an informal chat. If Acupuncture would not be helpful, I can normally suggest another reliable professional practitioner in the area who might be able to help.

As well as physical health benefits,  Acupuncture treatment also helps people feel better emotionally, so my clients often report more personal effects like feeling more energised, content, confident, relaxed etc Many people come to be specifically for help with issues relating to their emotions.

Acupuncture works by stimulating the body’s own natural processes to heal itself and stay in balance and so affects all aspects of a person, for this reason any list of conditions treated is incomplete;  the following link gives the results of a 2003 review by the World Health Organisation of formal scientific research into Acupuncture. While it doesn’t cover all bases I think it does give a good flavour of how Acupuncture treats all aspects of individual health so you might find it useful.

If you are not sure whether Acupuncture could help you then just get in touch using one of the methods at the bottom of this page to have an informal chat, like all forms of medicine Acupuncture cannot help everyone or every condition but it is often a good choice even when other approaches have not helped.
