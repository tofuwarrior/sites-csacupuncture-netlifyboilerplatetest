  Traditional Acupuncture is a complete form of medicine with a history of continuous clinical practise and refinement reaching back over 2000 years.
  It is a **complete understanding of the body and mind** and so this allows Acupuncture to offer care for both body and mind. 
  Treatment not only **removes symptoms of illness or injury but helps patients feeling better emotionally**. 
  All of this happens as result of the application of an elegant system of medicine that works to stimulate the body's own natural healing mechanisms.
