<p>Traditional Acupuncture is an amazing and complete form of medicine with a history of continuous clinical practise and refinement reaching back over 2000 years. It is an integrated understanding of the body and mind and so this allows Acupuncturists to treat all aspects of a person, for this reason, treatment not only removes symptoms of illness or injury but often, also leaves patients feeling better in themselves. All of this happens as result of the same treatment and the application of a gentle treatment system that works to stimulate the bodies own natural healing mechanisms.
