It is not widely known that Children's Acupuncture is often able to gently resolve many of the issues of childhood that we assume just have to be accepted.
The majority of children happily accept Acupuncture treatment and for some, No-Needle acupuncture methods such as Tui Na (chinese therapeutic massage) or moxibustion are often highly effective.

Children are very responsive to Acupuncture.  As they are so young, their system has not had enough time to get stuck out of balance so they often need minimal treatment to resolve a problem.

### Acupuncture helps many aspects of children's wellbeing but issues I commonly help are found below.
