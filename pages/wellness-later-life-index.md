Acupuncture has an integrated understanding of ageing and provides many insights that can help us live better for longer. It is usually true, that as we get older things in our bodies can start to 'go wrong'. While ageing is inevitable, and of course, Acupuncture cannot stop you ageing, it can do a lot to allow you still to live well. It does this by minimising some issues with ageing so they don't significantly reduce your quality of life. 

Some conditions like sleep issues, pain or digestive problems, may be able to be **resolved fully**, others such as Arthritis cannot be 'cured' but **treatment alleviates the symptoms very significantly**. 

Arthritis is an excellent example of an 'incurable' condition where Acupuncture can still give real benefits. I have seen many patients with Arthritis. Naturally, Acupuncture cannot reverse the physical wear in the joints BUT I have lots of patients where having a small amount of Acupuncture or Moxibustion stops them experiencing pain from their Arthritis and keeps their joints from being stiff. This allows them to keep mobile and doing what they enjoy. It also allows them to avoid taking pain relieving medications that have unwelcome side effects, this avoids medication related health problems in the future.

An Acupuncture consultation gives a unique individual picture of your health that allows treatment to improve or resolve health issues and for you to know how best to look after yourself.
