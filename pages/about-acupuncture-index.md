  Traditional Acupuncture is a complete system of medicine with a history of continuous practise and refinement reaching back well over 2000 years.
  It is an **understanding of the body and mind as a complete system** and so this allows it to offer effective care for both emotional and physical issues. 
  Treatment is focussed on balancing areas of your body's functioning that are imbalanced and so **it removes the causes of symptoms and also often helps you feel better emotionally**. 
  All of this happens, without harmful side effects, as a result of treatment that stimulates the body's own natural healing mechanisms.
