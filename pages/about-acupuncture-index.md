  Traditional Acupuncture is a complete system of medicine with a history of continuous practise and refinement reaching back well over 2000 years.
  It is a **complete understanding of the body and mind** and so this allows it to offer effective care for both. 
  Treatment not only **removes symptoms of illness or injury but helps you feel better emotionally**. 
  All of this happens, without harmful side effects, as a result of the application of an elegant system of medicine that stimulates the body's own natural healing mechanisms.
