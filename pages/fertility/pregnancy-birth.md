<h3>What Treatment Has to Offer</h3>
<p>Pregnancy often does not involve, 'glowing'. Difficulties are common as your body undergoes such a significant change. Acupuncture is one of the safest forms of medicine for you and your baby and provides relief to women every day.</p>
<p>Commonly helped conditions are:
    <ul>
    <li>tiredness</li>
     <li>joint pain</li>
     <li>sickness</li>
     <li>headaches</li>
    <li>emotional distress</li> 
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>What Treatment Involves</h3>
<p>
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to you, this involves acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments that can be made in daily life to help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand the problem and resolve it naturally.</p>

<h3>Additional Training</h3>
<p>The treatment of fertility is one of my 2 specialisms, the other being the treatment of children. <br/>
As well as my years of accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed specialist additional training with world renowned fertility expert Jane Lyttleton, I also engage in continuing additional study.
