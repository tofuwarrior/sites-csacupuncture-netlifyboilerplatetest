<h3>What Treatment Has to Offer</h3>
<p>Pregnancy often does not involve, 'glowing'. Difficulties are common as your body undergoes such a significant change. Acupuncture is one of the safest forms of medicine for you and your baby and provides both emotional and physial relief to women every day.</p>
<p>Commonly helped conditions are:
    <ul>
        <li>tiredness</li>
        <li>joint pain</li>
        <li>sickness</li>
        <li>digestive upset and reflux</li>
        <li>headaches</li>
        <li>emotional distress</li> 
    </ul>
</p>

### What Treatment Involves
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to what is important to you. This involves Acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments that can be made in daily life to help support you to feel your best. It may also include other [chinese medicine treatment techniques](/about-acupuncture/treatment-methods.html).  We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand the problem and resolve it naturally.
