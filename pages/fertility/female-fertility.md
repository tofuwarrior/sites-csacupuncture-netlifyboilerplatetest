title: Acupuncture for Female Fertility

 Bearing witness to the experiences of friends and family before I was qualified as well as supporting many patients coping with fertility issues has allowed me to understand the level of feeling it can involve when a successful pregnancy hasn't happened. This is why successful treatment to improve fertility is so life changing and why I am deeply invested in providing this kind of support. 

### My Fertility Experience & Training
As well as my years of accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed extensive additional fertility training delivered by Jane Lyttleton who is an internationally respected author and edeucator in the field of Acupuncture and fertility.  I have been helping both male and female patients with fertility issues since 2012.

### What Treatment Has to Offer
  Acupuncture has an established scientific reputation increasing the success rates of people trying for a baby. 
Fertility is a complex issue, with many factors involved so the holistic approach of Acupuncture, looking at the whole of you and treating you as a whole person, is ideal for addressing issues of this nature.
Often fertility issues are resolved without additional treatment but if assisted reproduction therapy (IVF, IUI, ICSI etc) are being used, it has much to offer to increase the chances of success and also to help couples cope with the side-effects of this kind of medical treatment.

  Sometimes it can be helpful for both partners in a couple to receive Acupuncture as Acupuncture can positively affect both male and female fertility. If you have been struggling to get pregnant, it can sometimes be because something is not quite right in your system and for some a simple course of treatment or some simple lifestyle adjustments is enough to tip the balance enough. I have had plenty of patients over the years where they have got pregnant shortly after starting a course of Acupuncture and most people know of someone who got pregnant when they reduced their workload or changed their diet. This is because sometimes it is a relatively small thing that is stopping pregnancy happening. 

More commonly though it takes a little more time and for some, we see positive changes in fertility indicators but they opt to combine the positive effects of Acupuncture with Assisted Reproduction Therapy.

These are all personal decisions which I support you in making with emotional support and advice.

### What Treatment Involves

 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to you, this involves acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments that can be made in daily life to help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand the problem and resolve it naturally.

Each time I see you, we review how you have been since the last appointment, look for signs of improvement and decide whether our current approach to treatment is still the best for you or whether we should make any adjustments. Each treatment is individual and tailored to how you are on the day I see you.
