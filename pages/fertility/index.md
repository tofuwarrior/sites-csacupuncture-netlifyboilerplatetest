<p> The experiences of friends and family as well as supporting many patients coping with fertility issues mean I understand the level of distress it can involve when a successful pregnancy doesn't happen. This is why successful treatment to improve fertility is so life changing and why I am so passionate about it.</p>

<h3>What Treatment Has to Offer</h3>
<p> Acupuncture has a well deserved scientific reputation for making the significant difference to both men and women when it comes to helping fertility. Fertility is a complex thing, with many factors involved so the holistic approach of Acupuncture, looking at the whole of you and treating you as a whole person, is ideal for addressing issues of this nature.<br/>
Often fertility issues are resolved without additional treatment but if assisted reproduction techniques are being used, it has much to offer to increase the chances of success and to help couples cope with the side-effects of this kind of medical treatment.

<h3>What Treatment Involves</h3>
<p>
 I combine the ancient knowledge of Acupuncture with modern scientific insights to provide individualised treatment tailored to you, this involves acupuncture treatment but also often involves advice about adjustments that can be made in daily life to help support you to be at your best. We work together with any additional information you may have from medical tests to understand the problem and resolve it naturally.</p>

<h3>Additional Training</h3>
<p>The treatment of fertility is one of my 2 specialisms, the other being the treatment of children. <br/>
As well as my years of accumulated experience and additional study since I graduated in 2012, I have also completed specialist additional training with world renowned fertility expert Jane Lyttleton, I also engage in continuing additional learning.
