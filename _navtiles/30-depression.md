Commonly occurring with anxiety, depression is a very common form of emotional distress made worse by the fact that society often doesn't recognise how overwhelming and debilitating it can be. It often leaves people feeling powerless because even though we want to feel happier, we can't just change our emotional state with a click of our fingers. Acupuncture works to balance the body & mind, by understanding why our system is suppressed treatment can bring us to a state where we feel energy, motivation and joy once more.
