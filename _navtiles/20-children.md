As with babies & toddlers, children respond well to Acupuncture, often requiring minimal treatment. Most children happily accept treatment with or without needles.  It helps to resolve many difficulties both physical and emotional. Common issues that are helped are asthma, eczema & allergies,  pain, digestion & appettite, concentration & behaviour, sleep, bedwetting & recurrent illness.
