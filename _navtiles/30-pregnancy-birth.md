Pregnancy often does not involve, 'glowing'. Challenges such as tiredness, joint pain, nausea, headaches and emotional distress are very common. When practised by a professionally trained Acupuncturist, Acupuncture is one of the safest forms of medicine for you and your baby and provides relief to women every day.  It is also commonly used to help with breech presentation of babies and to promote safe and fulfilling birth.
