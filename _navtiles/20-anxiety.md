Anxiety is one of the most common and sometimes most overwhelming forms of emotional distress. Modern life with its many demands can leave us feeling over-stimulated but depleted at the same time with us often feeling powerless because even though we want to, we can't change our emotional state. Acupuncture works to balance the body & mind, addressing the overstimulation we are experiencing and bringing us to a state where we feel calm and in control once more.
