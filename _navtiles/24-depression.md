If you are depressed you may be feeling feeling powerless because even though we want to feel happier, we can't just change our emotional state with a click of our fingers. Acupuncture works to balance the body & mind, by understanding where our system is depressed and where overloaded, treatment can help bring us to a state where we feel energy, motivation and joy once more.
