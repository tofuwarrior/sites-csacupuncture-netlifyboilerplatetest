When we are depressed we can feel powerless or trapped because even though we want to feel more content, we can't just change our emotional state with a click of our fingers. Acupuncture works to balance the body & mind, by understanding where our system is depressed and where overloaded, treatment can help bring us to a state where we feel energy, motivation and joy once more.
