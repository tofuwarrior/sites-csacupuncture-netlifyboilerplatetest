Acupuncture is well known as assisting in improving fertility both in women and men, it can also support you if you are thinking about assisted reproduction treatment like IVF or IUI. I provide empathy and support in what can be an emotionally intense time.  Individualised treatment identifies issues which may be affecting your fertility and harmonises these so you are at your best.
