# Redirect Rules for Netlify (optional)

# These are ignored in local development
# Default redirect status codes are 301 (permanent)
# You can test if your rules are valid here: https://play.netlify.com/redirects

# If you just want to remove the .html from your URLs, or if you want to remove
# the trailing slash, you should activate Pretty URLs in Netlify at:-
# Settings > Build & deploy > Post processing > Asset optimization

# Examples (uncomment before use and make sure this file is listed in the
# processing includes in Jekyll's _config.yml)

#/my-old-page         /my-new-page
#/old-content.html    /shiny-new-content.html
#/page-1              /page-2                   302
